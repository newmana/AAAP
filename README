This is an update/fork of:

This adds some new functionality and removes some bugs.

Changes
=======

Version 1.0
-----------
* Adds method onNoResults (when the AJAX query returns no results).
* Adds method onKeypressed (when user types something in to the text box).
* Doesn't allow submission (on Enter or TAB) if there are no results
 returned by the initial query.
